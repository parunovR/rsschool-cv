### About:
Currently working on a project (CRM-system) as html&css-coder. My main tasks: creating page layouts and elements from design, organizing styles.

I'm trying to learn Javascript, because it's already boring only coding in html and css. And also because I'm stuck at the same level, and I want to improve my skills.

### Skills:
* HTML5, CSS3
* Gulp, SASS, Bootstrap
* JavaScript (basic, in progres)
* Git (GitHub, Bitbucket)
* Apps: Photoshop, Figma, Sublime Text, VSCode

### Languages:
* Ukrainian - Native
